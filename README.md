# 📝 Flask Blog App

A dynamic blog web application built using **Flask**, **WTForms**, **Flask-Bootstrap**, and **CKEditor**. This project was created while learning from [The App Brewery's Complete Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).

## 📚 About the Project

This app allows users to:
- Create and manage blog posts
- Format blog content using a rich text editor (CKEditor)
- Store post data including title, author, date, subtitle, body, and image URL
- Render blog posts using Flask and Jinja templates

This project gave me hands-on experience with backend form handling, data modeling with SQLAlchemy, and integrating external Flask extensions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Flask
- Flask-Bootstrap (via Bootstrap 5)
- Flask-WTF & WTForms
- Flask-CKEditor
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- SQLite
- HTML / Jinja2 Templates
